# J-clib

## Description

This is a Personal C library, It was made for learning porpuses but then i realized it general usefulness so i decided to add more functions.
I advise you to not use this library for anything serious, it is functional and i dont think it has any serious errors but even like that I'm just a bored hobbyist so beaware
